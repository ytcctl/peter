    "**Welcome to the first stage of your deep learning journey!** In this notebook, we'll lay the foundation for our image classification project by acquiring and thoroughly understanding our dataset. A deep understanding of the data is crucial for building effective models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Objectives for this Stage:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Download and Load**: Use `torchvision` to efficiently acquire the CIFAR-10 dataset.\n",
    "- **Explore Structure**: Understand the dataset's components, size, and format.\n",
    "- **Visualize Samples**: Look at images from each class to build intuition about the data.\n",
    "- **Analyze Distribution**: Check the balance of classes to identify potential biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Why This Stage Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "The principle of **\"Garbage in, garbage out\"** is fundamental in machine learning. The quality of our model is capped by the quality of our data. By meticulously analyzing the dataset now, we can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make informed decisions about data preprocessing and augmentation.\n",
    "- Identify and mitigate potential issues early on.\n",
    "- Develop a strong intuition for the classification challenge ahead.\n",
